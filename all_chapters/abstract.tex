This thesis proposes a novel GPU implementation for merging two sorted arrays. 

We consider the problem of merging two arrays $A$ and $B$ into a single array $C$. 
Each element in the arrays has a key. An ordering relation denoted by $\leq$ 
is defined on the keys. Array $A$ and $B$ has $m$ and $n$ elements, respectively, 
where $m$ and $n$ do not have be to equal.  
Both array $A$ and array $B$ are sorted based on the ordering relation. 
The task is to produce the output array $C$ of size $m+n$.  
Array $C$ consists of all the input elements from array $A$ and $B$, and is 
sorted by the ordering relation. 

We applied several GPU-specific optimizations to the parallel merge algorithm. 
The optimizations include coordinating the memory access pattern, 
making full use of the shared memory and reducing the thread divergence.
Our implementation achieves more than 10x speedup compared to sequential merge, and
at most 20x speedup compared to thrust merge implementation.

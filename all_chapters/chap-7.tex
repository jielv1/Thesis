\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}
In this thesis, we implemented three versions of parallel merge algorithm on GPU: 
naive parallel merge, single buffer parallel merge and double buffer parallel merge.

We evaluated their performance on different GPUs. Among the three versions, single 
buffer parallel merge had the best performance. Compared to sequential merge,
single buffer parallel merge achieved 10x speedup. Compared to thrust merge 
implementation, single buffer parallel merge achieved at most 20x speedup 
for certain GPU architecture.
